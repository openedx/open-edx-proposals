Context
=======

"This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be
called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply
describing facts." [#]_

This is similar to the Motivation section of _`an OEP`.

Decision
========

"This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full
sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."" [#]_

This section could include details that might appear in any of the following
sections in _`an OEP`: Specification, Rationale, Backward Compatibility,
Reference Implementation, and Rejected Alternatives.

Consequences
============

"This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All
consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them
affect the team and project in the future." [#]_

This section does not directly align with an of the sections of _`an OEP`.
