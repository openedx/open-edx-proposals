OEP-XXX: OEP Template

Abstract
========

The abstract is a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue that
this Open edX proposal (OEP) addresses.

Motivation
==========

The motivation is critical for OEPs that will change Open edX. Explain why the
existing architecture or process is inadequate to address the problem that the
OEP solves, or why adopting the best practice would significantly improve Open
edX.

OEP submissions without sufficiently clear and compelling motivation are
unlikely to be accepted.

Specification
=============

The specification describes the technical details of the Architecture, Best
Practice, Process or Product Enhancement proposed by the OEP. If the proposal
includes a new API, specify its syntax and semantics.

Rationale
=========

The rationale adds to the specification by describing the events or
requirements that led the proposal, what influenced the design, and why
particular design decisions were made. It should describe any alternate designs
that were considered and identify any related work, for example, how the
feature is supported in other systems.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion. It should
also link to any major and pertinent discussions of the OEP that happened in
other fora (such as the `edx-code`_ mailing list).

Backward Compatibility
======================

This statement identifies whether the proposed change is backward compatible.
An OEP that introduces backward incompatibilities must describe the
incompatibilities, with their severity and an explanation of how you propose to
address these incompatibilities.

OEP submissions that do not consider backward compatibility issues are unlikely
to be accepted.


Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation must be completed before any OEP is given "Final"
status, but it need not be completed before the OEP is accepted. While there is
merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale
before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is
still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

The final implementation must include test code and documentation, following
the `Open edX Contribution Guidelines`_.

Rejected Alternatives
=====================

This statement describes any alternative designs or implementations that were
considered and rejected, and why they were not implemented. It should also link
to the original source of that discussion.


Change History
==============

A list of dated sections that describes a brief summary of each revision of the
OEP.
