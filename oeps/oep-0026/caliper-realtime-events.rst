========================
Caliper Real-time Events
========================

The Caliper standard supports multiple Profiles_ for different types of learning activities.

In particular, the following profiles may be of interest to Adaptive use cases:

* Assessment Profile - for summative assessments
* Assignable Profile - for formative assessments
* Grading Profile - for scorable activities
* Reading Profile - for text-based activities
* Media Profile - for audio, image, and video-based activities

.. Note:: We will update this document with a proposed mapping between Open edX events and Caliper events, when development resources for this effort are confirmed. In the meantime, please stay tuned or help us fill this out. Thanks.
