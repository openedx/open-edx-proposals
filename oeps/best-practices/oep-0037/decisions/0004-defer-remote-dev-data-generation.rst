Defer Dev Data OEP Implementation
#################################

Status
******

Accepted

Context
*******

The Arch-BOM team recently created a proof-of-concept based on `OEP-37`_.  Based on this POC we looked to see if there
was interest in using the tool to create test data for use cases that product delivery teams at edX had.

The search for collaborators on this work showed us that teams are not currently able to prioritize the effort needed
to make use of any new tooling that Arch-BOM might create or enhance.

Decision
********

We will defer OEP-37 until there is sufficient support and interest that the work can succeed.

Consequences
