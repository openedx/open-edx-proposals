Context
-------

This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should
be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is
simply describing facts.

Decision
--------

This section describes our response to the forces described in the Context.
It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."

Consequences
------------

This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision.
All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them
affect the team and project in the future.

References
----------

List any additional references here that would be useful to the future reader.
