Abstract
========

Open edX application authorization guidelines. 

The Open edX platform currently has the capability to act as an OAuth2 [#rfc6749]_ provider (which is distinctly different from its OAuth2 client capability i.e. the "login with Social Network X" feature).

Site admins can create long-lived OAuth2 client application keys that can in turn be exchanged for shorter-lived access and refresh tokens. These keys can optionally be scoped down to a custom list of available authorizations.

We do not currently have a cohesive strategy for creating or managing scopes across the Open edX platform and have reached a point where further maturity is required in this area.

This proposal puts forward a strategy that is is straightforward for both application developers (those who need to know about the available scopes) and Open edX platform admins and service teams (those who need to implement the restrictions).

The goals of the proposed strategy are to:

* restrict the behavior of external applications that need to integrate with an
  Open edX deployment, in line with the principle of "least privilege"

* enable more of those applications with low friction (optimize for ease of
  integration over ease of development)

* centralize legislation of authorization platform-wide, but federate and
  decentralize enforcement

* avoid dictating technology and protocol choices, but have clear guidance for
  implementation practices

Motivation
==========

The Open edX platform, in its current state, has a very limited mechanism for restricting the authorization of third-party applications to access user data. This limitation has dampened the ability of the platform to enable an ecosystem of third party applications.

Application developers have a harder time convincing their users that those users should grant these applications "access to everything the user can see and do", especially for special purpose applications that only need a small slice of the user's data to operate.

Instead of needing to trust both the platform and all applications built on the platform, our architecture should allow users to simply trust the platform's ability to delegate very specific data sets to third-parties at the user's request.

Rationale
=========

The discussion of scopes and application authorization has come up many times, but only recently have we (at edx.org) started to see a meaningful number of requests from external application developers that want to build on our platform.

For example, certain applications would like access to our edx.org course catalog for use cases like affiliate marketing and content repurposing. In this case, we want to be able to grant applications read-only access to our catalog, but not write access, and not access to any other resources (such as enrollments or user profiles).

Specification
=============

Data model
----------

============ ==================================================================
Object       Description
============ ==================================================================
service user an Open edX account created solely for server-to-server
             integrations; can have multiple associated applications
application  an autonomous system that needs to integrate with an Open edX
             platform, owned by a single service user
resource     named grouping of related capabilities. Will generally (not
             always) be a noun like "catalog"
action       describes a high-level behavior and will generally be "read" or
             "write", but resources may use non-standard definitions where
             absolutely necessary (should be the exception)
scope        a single authorization (naming convention: ``resource:action``)
             for an application relative to an Open edX instance; should only
             describe broad application authorization (as opposed to, say,
             fine-grained user authorizations)
access token a temporary credential that grants a set of scopes to an
             application
============ ==================================================================

I sketched these relationships out in the diagram below. Note that instead of using "read/write" as actions, I noted the HTTP verbs instead, just to give a sense for the implementation details we've got in mind at this point. Same ideas though.

        resources through applications, scopes, and resource actions.

Governance
----------
* Centralize the complete list of scopes but decentralize the associated
  metadata and definitions

* The central documented list of scopes must be readily available to
  application developers and service owners, and kept up to date

* Centralize application and token management but decentralize token
  enforcement

* Centralize common implementation patterns as we encounter them (logging,
  enforcement, etc)

* Access tokens may have one or more scopes associated to them by the central
  authorization service; tokens should be functionally opaque to applications

* Scopes should cover all RESTful web API endpoints [#REST]_ within a service,
  and may also cover other endpoints as desired by the service team

* Resources should not leak implementation details or internal names, i.e.,
  instead of ``otto_cart``, consider just ``cart`` or ``shopping_cart``

* Resources should not, on the other hand, be too broad to be useful, i.e.,
  instead of ``courseware``, consider ``discussions`` or ``catalog`` or
  whatever specific resource is of interest

Open questions
--------------
* Where, exactly, are we going to maintain the list of all scopes, and which
  scopes should we start with?

* How will we manage scope metadata, such as the human-readable "this is the
  permission you're authorizing" text for the OAuth pop-up (and localization
  considerations)?

* What is a good strategy for application lifecycle management, such as the
  recommended approval flow for key creation and revocation?

* What work is required to implement this proposal across the Open edX
  platform, including (but not limited to) the `edx-platform`_ codebase?

Backward Compatibility
=======================

There are no backwards compatibility issues with rolling out a centralized scopes list in our OAuth2 provider, or linking scopes to existing client applications.

However, there *might* be issues once we start enforcing scopes on individual service endpoints, as existing client applications that once might have had broader access may get suddenly cut off from data sources that we didn't know were being used. We will need to spend time up front understanding current access patterns in order to estimate the impact of this potentially breaking change and in order to correctly retrofit scopes onto existing application keys.
