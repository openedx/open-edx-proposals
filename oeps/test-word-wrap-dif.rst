What is an Open edX Proposal?
===============

Using Word Wrap
***************

OEP (pronounced "oh-epp") stands for Open edX (Enhancement) Proposal. An OEP is a document that details a specific technology decision being made by the Open edX community, in the form of a best practice, architecture design, or process adjustment. An OEP should provide the use cases and rationales that surround that choice. OEPs are not the only way for a change to be made to Open edX, however. The goal is to create a collection of OEP documents as a repository or knowledge archive of architectural choices made for the platform.

Small enhancements or patches often don't need an OEP and can be injected into the Open edX development workflow with a patch submission. OEP templates are available to help you provide all of the necessary information for your proposal.
