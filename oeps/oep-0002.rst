Abstract
========

Proposes a standard format for repository metadata for Open edX projects.

Motivation
==========

One of the primary goals for Best Practice OEPs is to standardize techniques
and tools across Open edX repositories. However, without
tooling, it will be difficult to move all of the repositories in the same
direction (and hard to validate which ones have been updated). This OEP exists
to fill that gap.  By providing a standard format for metadata about accordance
to Best Practice OEPs, tools can be developed in the future to report on the
current status of all of the Open edX repositories, and how well they follow
the Best Practices listed in the OEPs.

Bear in mind that particular classes of Open edX repositories may have
different Best Practices. The practices that apply to an XBlock may not be the
same as those that apply to a standalone Django service or to a Django app.

Specification
=============

Each repo in the Open edX system will include a file ``openedx.yaml``, with the
following fields:

``owner``: string
    The github user/team responsible for the repository.

``nick``: string (optional)
    A short-name for the repository used by reporting tools created by the
    edX Open Source team. Should be 3-4 characters, because this value
    is used in charts with very limited space on their axes.

``tags``: list of strings (optional)
    Used to group repositories by in reporting tools. Sample tags: core,
    mobile analytics.

``oeps``: dictionary (optional)
    A list of keys corresponding to Best Practice OEPs (in the format
    ``oep-n``). Each value would be one of ``True``, ``False``, or a reason
    dictionary. ``True`` and ``False`` would indicate accordance (or lack
    thereof) with the specified OEP. A reason dictionary provides more detailed
    information. It can contain a boolean ``state``, a boolean ``applicable``,
    and a string ``reason``. If the OEP is not applicable to this repository,
    the reason dictionary can simply contain a single value of ``False`` for the
    ``applicable`` key. A ``False`` value for ``applicable`` indicates the OEP
    will never be applicable to this repository. For example: an OEP that
    defines a best practices for Javascript testing would be marked as not
    applicable in a python command line tool's repository. If the ``state`` is
    ``False`` a ``reason`` value must be included that explains why. If the
    ``state`` is ``True`` or ``applicable`` is ``False`` the ``reason`` can
    optionally provide more information. The ``reason`` value will be displayed
    in reporting tools. If an OEP isn't listed in the ``oeps`` dictionary, then
    it is assumed to be ``False``, unless the reporting tool can auto-detect
    accordance.

``track-pulls``: boolean (optional)

    .. This should be moved to a separate OEP

    Whether or not this repository should be tracked for creation of OSPR tickets.

``openedx-release``: defined by :doc:`OEP-10 <oep-0010>`.

``obsolete``: boolean (optional)
    If ``True``, this specifies that this repository is obsolete and no longer
    maintained by ``edX``.


For example, in the `edx-platform`_ repo, the file might look like:

.. _edx-platform: https://github.com/edx/edx-platform

.. code-block:: yaml

    # openedx.yaml

    ---
    owner: edx/teaching-and-learning
    nick: edx
    tags:
        - core
        - xblock
        - lms
        - studio
    oeps:
        oep-314: True  # edx-platform uses django 3.14
        oep-42:
            state: False
            reason: This OEP doesn't actually exist
        oep-2:
            state: True  # no reason is required since this is True
        oep-100:
            applicable: False  # state is not required since the OEP is not applicable
            reason: This OEP contains best practices for C++ which is not used in edx-platform
        oep-101:
            applicable: False  # reason is not required since it's almost always just a redundant statement about it not being applicable


Rationale
=========

The keys in ``openedx.yaml`` were derived from existing repository metadata collected
by edx.org.

The design of the ``oeps`` dictionary was guided by a couple of use cases:

1. Adding a new OEP that few repositories will support, initially. We shouldn't
   need to update all repositories to detect if they are in accordance, we should
   be able to assume that they aren't, or automatically detect whether they are.
2. Repositories may have specific requirements that force them to not implement a
   best practice. The tools should be able to present that reasoning to anyone
   looking across repositories, and the reasons should be documented in the repositories
   themselves.
3. As much as possible, Best Practices should be autodetected, but because they will
   often involve a judgement call, autodetection shouldn't be mandatory.
