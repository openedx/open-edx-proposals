Open edX Proposals Index
========================

OEP (pronounced “oh-epp”) stands for Open edX (Enhancement) Proposal. An OEP is
a document that details a specific technology decision being made by the Open
edX community, in the form of a best practice, architecture design, or process
adjustment. An OEP should provide the use cases and rationales that surround that
choice. OEPs are not the only way for a change to be made to Open edX, however,
the goal is to create a collection of OEP documents as a repository or knowledge
archive of large and broadly relevant choices made for the platform.
